Since the functionality for HTML and servers are not done, no code will be in this branch. If you want to have a look at the code of the server and the client, you can go to branch "vk" and have a look in folder 
        -"Brython"
        -"gitinspector-master"
        -"printing data on HTML page using Python"
        -"server"
        -"web2py"
The functionality to identify files inside a folder is not completed and still has issues. If you want to have a look at the code, you can go to branch "ia" and have a look in folder Artifacts.
